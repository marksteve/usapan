    <p>Children of the sun, see your time has just begun, searching for your ways, through adventures every day. Every
      day and night, with the condor in flight, with all your friends in tow, you search for the Cities of Gold.
      Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah… wishing for The Cities of Gold. Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah… some day we will find The Cities of Gold.
      Do-do-do-do ah-ah-ah, do-do-do-do, Cities of Gold. Do-do-do-do, Cities of Gold. Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah… some day we will
      find The Cities of Gold.</p>
    <p>I never spend much time in school but I taught ladies plenty. It’s true I hire my body out for pay, hey hey. I’ve
      gotten burned over Cheryl Tiegs, blown up for Raquel Welch. But when I end up in the hay it’s only hay, hey hey. I
      might jump an open drawbridge, or Tarzan from a vine. ’Cause I’m the unknown stuntman that makes Eastwood look so
      fine.</p>
    <p>This is my boss, Jonathan Hart, a self-made millionaire, he’s quite a guy. This is Mrs H., she’s gorgeous, she’s
      one lady who knows how to take care of herself. By the way, my name is Max. I take care of both of them, which
      ain’t easy, ’cause when they met it was MURDER!</p>
